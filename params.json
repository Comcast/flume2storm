{"name":"Flume2Storm","tagline":"","body":"The Flume2Storm Connector is a modular project that bridges [Flume](http://flume.apache.org/) to [Storm](http://storm-project.net/documentation/Home.html), so that Flume events can be forwarded to and processed in Storm. \r\nThe two main components are the storm-sink (in Flume) and the flume-spout (in Storm). The flume-spout connects to the storm-sink, which can then sends the events. In order for the spout to connect the sink, they both use a location service. \r\n\r\nThe architectural choice for this connector is to be modular and abstract in the sense that both the location service and the connection framework are API. The storm-sink and the flume-spout configure which implementation of these API to use.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nOverview and usage documentation can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/Comcast/flume2storm/wiki).\r\nThe source code contains extensive (javadoc) documentation.\r\n\r\n# Releases\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
